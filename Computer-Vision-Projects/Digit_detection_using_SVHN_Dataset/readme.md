This code contains implementation of FasterRCNN from scratch to detect Digits on a image , trained on SVHN dataset provided publicly. <br>
This code takes a long time to train , around 12-14 minutes per epoch. <br>
It needs a lot of optimization , will be working on it to imrpove its time , final results and performance.
<br>
Hope this is of some help to someone to learn FasterRCNN implementation.
