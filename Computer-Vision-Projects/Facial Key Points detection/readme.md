While searching about some projects in computer vision online , I got to know about facial keypoint detection .
<br>
This task came to be very good , its applications just facinated my mind and hence i thought to give it a try.
<br>
So , first i worked on searching a dataset related to this task, Couldn't find a well prepared dataset. Then i found about the Flickr High Resolution dataset , it can be accessed from https://github.com/NVlabs/ffhq-dataset.
The actual dataset was really a quite big and hence i had to make it small and convinient so that i can easily train on it.
<br>
Currently the dataset contains 5000 images and a json file having the face landmarks. <br>
You can download the dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/prashantarorat/facial-key-point-data .
<br>
I will be constantly creating and updating this dataset with new versions .
<br>
A sample of result.
