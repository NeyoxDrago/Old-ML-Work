## YOLO :: YOU ONLY LOOK ONCE

<br>Just for learning purpose i found a beautiful tutorial on how to implement YoloV3 archietecture from scratch.
<br>So i just started and get this task done while learning a lot of new things.

<p>
This repository consists of implementation of YoloV3 from scratch.
<br> You can find the refrence tutorial from https://machinelearningspace.com/blog/  ( Amazing blog )
<br> Curious about the model architecture, just have a look at the model.png file ( created with an input shape of (416,416,3) )

Example
