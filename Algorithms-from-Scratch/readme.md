In this repository I would be implementing some of simple and most basic algorithms from scratch.
<p>
 
 Filename : Regression Algorithms from scratch .ipynb
 <br>
 This file contains implementation of following algorithms from scratch.
 <ul>
  <li> Linear Regression 
  <li> Ridge Regression
  <li> Lasso Regression
  <li> ElasticNet Regression
 </ul>
 
 Also i have implemented them as with validation process ( means passing a eval_set to the model while training as catboost and other algorithms does to overcome the problem of overfitting to some extend. )
